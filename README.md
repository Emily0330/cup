This is our project for [Google Solution Challenge 2023](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge).

## Basic Info
### Project: Eco-cups
### Authors: @skwiz23 , @CYJ1111 , @Emily0330
**from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung university and National Tsing Hua University**
### SDGs: 
* Goal 11: Sustainable Cities
* Goal 12: Responsible Consumption & Production
* Goal 14: Life Below Water
* Goal 15: Life on Land

**It is estimated that this project can reduce approximately 5 million disposable cups a year in Taiwan once implemented.**

### Introduction

We use the **blockchain** to record beverage shops that offer discounts for customers bringing their own cups.

We reward those shops with **CUP-tokens** every time customers buy drinks using their own cups. CUP-tokens can be used for other purposes.

Also, Consumers can record their purchases on the chain and accumulate points, which can be exchanged for drinks, etc.
